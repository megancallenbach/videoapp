This simple app for viewing trailers of different movies was created with ReactJS using `create-react-app`

## The project structure

The JavaScript/React code can be found in the `src/components/App` folder.
The styles were written in CSS and can be found in `App.css` in the root directory.

## Viewing the app

In the project directory, first install all dependencies by running the command:
### `npm i`

Then, to launch the app run the command:
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Development process

I chose to build this project in ReactJS because of the ease of use. The app is kept simple. The posters are displayed in squares and when a poster is clicked on the movie trailer opens in a modal. To remove the modal click anywhere on the screen again.
